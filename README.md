# InspectionsApp

The application is designed to facilitate various inspections, with each inspection type involving
multiple questions. Each question offers at least 2 answer choices, ranging in value from 0 to 1.
An option for &#39;Not Applicable&#39; (N/A) answers is also available. Every question must be answered
with a single answer to allow an inspection to be submitted to the system.
Inspections could be completed offline and submitted upon completion. Inspectors can save
partial inspections and resume them later. Inspections are tied to specific areas within the
organization, with each type of inspection scheduled at regular intervals. Upon completion, the
app calculates and displays the final inspection score by summing up the scores of all answered
questions.
Users can access past inspection results and view upcoming inspections.
